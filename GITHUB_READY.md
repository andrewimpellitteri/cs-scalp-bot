# GitHub Upload Checklist

## ‚úÖ This Project is SAFE to Upload to GitHub

All sensitive information has been properly protected. Here's what you need to know:

## What's Protected

### Files That Will NOT Be Uploaded (Gitignored)

The `.gitignore` file ensures these sensitive items stay local:

```
‚úÖ .env                    # Your API credentials
‚úÖ data/                   # Trade history and database
‚úÖ tokens.json            # Schwab API tokens
‚úÖ **/*.tokens.json       # Any token files anywhere
‚úÖ .venv/                 # Python virtual environment
‚úÖ __pycache__/           # Python bytecode
‚úÖ *.db                   # Database files
‚úÖ *.log                  # Log files
```

### Files That WILL Be Uploaded (Safe)

All code and documentation - no secrets:

```
‚úÖ All Python source code (src/)
‚úÖ README.md, CLAUDE.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md
‚úÖ Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
‚úÖ pyproject.toml (dependencies only)
‚úÖ .gitignore itself
‚úÖ LICENSE
‚úÖ .env.example (template with no real values)
‚úÖ config.example.json (template with no real values)
```

## Pre-Upload Verification

Run these checks before pushing to GitHub:

### 1. Check Git Status

```bash
cd ~/Documents/scalp_bot
git status
```

Look through the list - make sure you don't see:
- ‚ùå `.env`
- ‚ùå `data/`
- ‚ùå `tokens.json`
- ‚ùå Any files with real credentials

### 2. Check What Will Be Committed

```bash
git add .
git status
```

Review the "Changes to be committed" list carefully.

### 3. Search for Accidental Secrets

```bash
# Check for potential secrets in staged files
git grep -i "password\|secret\|key.*=" -- "*.py" "*.json" "*.yml" "*.md"
```

If you see any real credentials, remove them!

### 4. Verify .gitignore Is Working

```bash
# This should return nothing (data/ is ignored)
git ls-files | grep data/

# This should return nothing (.env is ignored)
git ls-files | grep "\.env$"

# This should return nothing (tokens.json is ignored)
git ls-files | grep tokens.json
```

If any of these return files, **STOP** and check your `.gitignore`.

## How to Upload to GitHub

### First Time Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "+" ‚Üí "New repository"
   - Name it `scalp_bot` (or whatever you want)
   - Choose "Private" (recommended) or "Public"
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/scalp_bot
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - scalping bot v0.1.0"
   ```

3. **Connect to GitHub**

   Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scalp_bot.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Enter GitHub Credentials**
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: your GitHub **Personal Access Token** (not your regular password)

   **Don't have a token?**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "scalp_bot"
   - Check the "repo" scope
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
   - Use this as your password when pushing

### Subsequent Updates

After making changes:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/scalp_bot

# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## What Your Dad Will Do

Once uploaded to GitHub, your dad (or anyone) can install it:

```bash
# Download the bot
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scalp_bot.git
cd scalp_bot

# Run it with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8000
```

That's it! All the dependencies and configuration are included.

## Making It Private vs Public

### Private Repository (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ Only you (and people you invite) can see it
- ‚úÖ Extra security layer
- ‚úÖ Free on GitHub
- ‚ùå Can't easily share with others

**To make private:**
- When creating repo, choose "Private"
- Or later: Go to Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone ‚Üí Change visibility

### Public Repository
- ‚úÖ Anyone can download and use it
- ‚úÖ Can share with others easily
- ‚úÖ Good for open source community
- ‚ùå Code is visible to everyone

**To make public:**
- When creating repo, choose "Public"
- Or later: Go to Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone ‚Üí Change visibility

**Even if public, your secrets are safe** (as long as `.gitignore` is working correctly)!

## Adding Collaborators (Private Repo)

To let your dad access a private repo:

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Collaborators"
4. Click "Add people"
5. Enter his GitHub username or email
6. He'll receive an invitation

## Documentation for Users

Your repository includes complete documentation:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Overview and quick start
2. **[SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step installation for non-programmers
3. **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Developer documentation
4. **[PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md](PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md)** - Checklist before going live
5. **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Security best practices
6. **[LICENSE](LICENSE)** - MIT License with disclaimers

## Final Safety Checks

Before making the repo public (if you choose to):

- [ ] No API credentials in code
- [ ] No account numbers in code
- [ ] No real trading data committed
- [ ] `.gitignore` working correctly
- [ ] `.env.example` has only placeholders
- [ ] `config.example.json` has only example values
- [ ] README warns users to test in dry-run first
- [ ] LICENSE includes financial disclaimer

## Updating the README for Your Repo

Before pushing, update the clone URL in `README.md` and `SETUP_GUIDE.md`:

Find lines like:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/scalp_bot.git
```

Replace with your actual URL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewimpellitteri/scalp_bot.git
```

## What Happens After Upload

1. **Your dad can download it** by following SETUP_GUIDE.md
2. **He won't have your credentials** (they're gitignored)
3. **He'll use his own Schwab account** and API credentials
4. **His data stays on his computer** (in his local `data/` folder)
5. **You can both make changes** without affecting each other

## Keeping Your Copy Private

If you want to work on a private version while having a public version:

1. Keep your personal trading version private and local
2. Create a separate "clean" public version without any personal data
3. Only push generic improvements to the public repo

## Ready to Upload?

Run this final verification:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/scalp_bot

# Make sure git is initialized
git status

# Check nothing sensitive is staged
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|key.*=.*[a-z0-9]"

# If the above returns nothing, you're good!
```

**If everything looks good, go ahead and push to GitHub!** üöÄ
