## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrewimpellitteri/cs-scalp-bot.git
   cd cs-scalp-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with uv**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   uv run scalp-bot
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**

   Open your browser to http://localhost:8000

## Docker Deployment

### Build and run with Docker Compose

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Start the bot (in dry-run mode by default)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the bot
docker-compose down
```

### Manual Docker build

```bash
# Build
docker build -t scalp-bot .

# Run
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data scalp-bot
```

## Configuration

The bot can be configured through the web dashboard or by modifying the configuration directly.

### Key Configuration Options

#### Strategy Settings
- **Entry Drop %**: Buy when price drops this percentage from recent high
- **Entry Timeframe**: Time window to measure price drops (default: 5 minutes)
- **Profit Target %**: Sell when profit reaches this percentage
- **Stop Loss %**: Sell when loss reaches this percentage
- **Trailing Stop**: Optional trailing stop instead of fixed profit target

#### Risk Management
- **Position Size %**: Percentage of account to use per trade
- **Max Positions**: Maximum concurrent positions
- **Max Daily Loss %**: Auto-shutdown if daily loss exceeds this
- **Max Daily Trades**: Maximum number of trades per day
- **Trade Frequency**: Minimum seconds between trades

#### Trading Hours
- **Avoid First Minutes**: Skip trading N minutes after market open (default: 30)
- **Avoid Last Minutes**: Skip trading N minutes before market close (default: 30)
- **Close at EOD**: Automatically close all positions before market close

## Trading Modes

### Dry Run Mode (Default)
- Simulates trades without real money
- Uses simulated market data with realistic price movements
- Perfect for testing strategies and getting familiar with the bot
- No Schwab API credentials required

### Live Mode
- Executes real trades through Charles Schwab API
- Requires Schwab developer API credentials
- **Use with caution** - real money at risk!

## Schwab Account Setup

### CRITICAL: Use a Separate Account!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never use your main Schwab account with the bot!**

Create a separate Schwab brokerage account for bot trading:

1. **Why it's important:**
   - Protects your main investments from any bot issues
   - Limits maximum loss to only what's in the test account
   - Makes performance tracking easier
   - Your main account stays completely untouched

2. **How to create a separate account (takes 10 minutes):**
   - Log in to Schwab.com with your existing account
   - Click "Open New Account" ‚Üí "Individual Brokerage Account"
   - Complete the application (uses same login as main account)
   - Fund with small amount for testing ($1,000-$2,000 recommended)
   - Write down the new account number

3. **Example protection:**
   - Main account: $100,000 (never touched)
   - Bot test account: $2,000 (bot only trades here)
   - Maximum possible loss: Only the $2,000 in test account

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md#step-3-set-up-a-separate-schwab-account-critical) for detailed instructions.

## Schwab API Setup (For Live Trading)

To use live trading, you'll need to set up the Schwab API:

1. **Apply for Schwab Developer Account**
   - Visit https://developer.schwab.com/
   - Create an account and apply for API access
   - Wait for approval (can take a few days)

2. **Create an App**
   - Create a new app in the Schwab developer portal
   - Note your App Key and App Secret

3. **Configure the Bot**
   - Set your credentials in the web dashboard or environment variables
   - `SCHWAB_APP_KEY`: Your app key
   - `SCHWAB_APP_SECRET`: Your app secret

4. **Authenticate**
   - The bot will guide you through OAuth authentication
   - Tokens are stored securely in `./data/tokens.json`

**Note**: The Schwab API integration is currently a placeholder. You'll need to implement the actual API calls using the `schwab-py` library or similar.

## Web Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

- **Status Panel**: Bot running state, trading mode, active symbols
- **Account Panel**: Balance, daily P&L, trade count
- **Performance Panel**: Open positions, wins/losses
- **Controls**: Start/stop bot, configure settings, close positions
- **Positions Table**: Real-time view of open positions with P&L

- **Trade Frequency**: Enforces minimum time between trades
- **Position Limits**: Controls maximum concurrent positions
- **Trading Hours**: Avoids volatile open/close periods
- **Emergency Stop**: Manual stop button and close-all-positions feature

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

### Run tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code formatting

```bash
uv run black src/
uv run ruff check src/
```

## Important Notes

- **Start in Dry Run**: Always test strategies in dry-run mode first
- **Test Account**: Use a separate Schwab account for testing
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch the bot closely when first running live
- **Risk Management**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- **Not Financial Advice**: This is educational software - use at your own risk

## Questions to Ask Before Configuring

Before going live, get answers to these questions:

1. **Entry/Exit**: Exact percentage drops for entry and profit targets?
2. **Stop Loss**: What stop-loss percentage?
3. **Position Sizing**: What % of account per trade?
4. **Risk Limits**: Max daily loss and max trades per day?
5. **Symbols**: Just TSLA or other stocks too?
6. **Trading Hours**: Any specific times to avoid?

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed questions to ask.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start
- Check logs for errors
- Ensure port 8000 is not already in use
- Verify dependencies are installed: `uv sync`

### No trades executing
- Verify bot is running (check dashboard)
- Check if risk limits are hit (daily loss, max trades)
- Ensure you're within trading hours
- Check strategy parameters (entry conditions might be too strict)

### Docker issues
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check data directory permissions: `chmod -R 755 data/`
- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
